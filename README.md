four-in-a-row
-------------

Yodle's four-in-a-row challenge. A work-related recruiting effort several of us contributed to in our spare time.

I committed as `Fend' or `will' and worked on the following aspects of the project:
- REST API definition
- Node.js server implementation and mongo storage of game state
- bash scripts to initiate and manipulate games
- Copy for the Landing Page
